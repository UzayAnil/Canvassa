The Legend of Canvassa
An open-source, Javascript+Dojo clone of the original "Legend of Zelda" game for the NES
Uses HTML5 Canvas (and ExplorerCanvas in Internet Explorer)

COMMIT HISTORY:
---------
6/10/2009

This is a preliminary sandboxed checkin, primarily repackaged for sharing on Github.
It is not at all complete, but as of the first checkin, the basic preloading and sprite engines are in place.
There are currently two entry points:
index.html -- the main game will be invoked from here; right now it's just the player on an empty screen.
bestiary.html -- test harness that allows you to spawn the various enemy types into a canvas to observe their AIs.

Note also that sprite collision isn't yet enabled in the initial checkin. However, it has been added in subsequent checkins; see Git checkin logs for details.

Some of the (many) updates in this checkin:
- added text to the page describing the game controls
- (re)implemented sounds
- made killed monsters leave behind hearts and rupees (fairies and clocks come later)
- added the sword projectile "flash" effect
- fixed bug: Reset button is broken
- fixed bug: erase "PAUSED" from notification area when unpausing


Still several things on the overworld that need to be fixed/implemented:

Monsters:
- zolas should be able to go on land
- zolas should shoot fireballs
- peahat AI is seriously messed up
- armos should wake up when touched
- need to correct the # of hits needed to kill everything

Items:
- add loc.Helper base item for sword and wand
- Fix projectile management (I'm not keeping track of them correctly, especially the sword)
  - ideally, instead of player.projectile = {}, we should have this:
  - player.swordProj = {}; player.itemProjs = []; loc.InventoryItem.maxProj = 1; player.getProjsOfType()
      loc.InventoryItem.getProj() = { if(len(player.getProjsOfType(this.declaredClass)) < this.maxProj) { // get proj } else { return Null; }
- Limit the blue candle to a single use per screen
- Split Items.js file into multiple subfiles, parallel to what Peter Higgins did to Monsters.js

Map:
- bug: need to permanently remove predefined items from the map when picked up (e.g. the wooden sword on the start screen -- grab it, leave the screen, then come back: it's there again!)
- add Z-index the Map class to allow for multiple map layers (think dungeons) in a single "world"

Game:
- improvement: Make Link & the monsters get knocked back when hit
- improvement: shield should block octoroc rocks if facing them and in state 0
- improvement: Disable AllItems cheat button after first use

Misc. improvements:
- add BigHearts and Silver/Master Swords to overworld map
- Provide a way to turn off sound and/or music
