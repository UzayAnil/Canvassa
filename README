The Legend of Canvassa
An open-source, Javascript+Dojo clone of the original "Legend of Zelda" game for the NES
Uses HTML5 Canvas (and ExplorerCanvas in Internet Explorer)

This is a preliminary sandboxed checkin, primarily repackaged for sharing on Github.
It is not at all complete, but as of this checkin, the basic preloading and sprite engines are in place.
There are currently two entry points:
index.html -- the main game will be invoked from here; right now it's just the player on an empty screen.
bestiary.html -- test harness that allows you to spawn the various enemy types into a canvas to observe their AIs.

Note also that sprite collision isn't yet enabled.
